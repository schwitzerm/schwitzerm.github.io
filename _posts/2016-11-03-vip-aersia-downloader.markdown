This is a short write up on a script I've just finished writing, the [VIP Aersia Downloader](https://github.com/schwitzerm/vip_aersia_downloader).

I've often used the [VIP Player](http://vip.aersia.net) to listen to various tracks of video game music. I'm the type of
person that prefers to keep all of music on my machine, so that in the case of a server going down, I've still access
to the music I enjoy.

This small project was a good opportunity to work on some Akka Streams knowledge, and to test it's capabilities.

In the end, I can download all 1095 tracks from the site in ~2 minutes. Not too shabby!

If you find the code useful, please give me a star! Thanks for reading!
